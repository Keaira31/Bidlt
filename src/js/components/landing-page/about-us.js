            <p> The website application of complete construction integration across all of construction and service sectors.
              BIDLT was created out of frustration, that construction and services had a lack of transparency, fairness and information. As a team we have spent time building new houses, renovating, room altering, office fitting and so on.<br></br><br></br>
               What we wanted was a platform that would be the one stop shop for our building requirements and needs. But as well as a back office instantly available without having to worry about loose papers being lost.<br></br><br></br>
                Itâ€™s those frustrations that BIDLT was created out of and BIDLT will always fight against those frustrations, and will always innovate for you.<br></br><br></br>
